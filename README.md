<h1>Section 1: Variables & User Input and Output</h1>
Welcome to the showcase of projects from Section 1 of my school learning journey in object-oriented Java programming. This section focuses on the foundational concepts of Variables and User Input and Output. Each project demonstrates my initial exposure to these fundamental concepts and their implementation.

<h2> Projects Overview </h2>
In this showcase of projects from Section 1 of my Java projects and Java learning journey, I present my first exposure to Java projects, focusing on Variables and User Input and Output. These projects allowed me to apply essential programming skills, such as defining and using variables, interacting with users through 'Scanner' and 'JOptionPane', and displaying output using 'System.out.println'. 
Through hands-on experience, I honed my ability to prompt and store user input, showcasing proficiency in fundamental Java syntax and data manipulation. These projects provided a solid foundation in programming concepts, laying the groundwork for more advanced topics in object-oriented programming. As a beginner, I eagerly embraced each project, gaining valuable insights into the world of Java development and setting the stage for further growth as a Java programmer.
<h2> Projects </h2>

<h3>Project 1: My Favs</h3>
This project introduces the concept of variables in Java and demonstrates how to display user-specific information using System.out.println. It prompts the user to enter their favorite movie, car choice, and graduation year, and then prints out the provided details.

<h3>Project 2: Hello Name<h3> 

In these projects, I explore user input using the Scanner class and JOption. The program asks for the user's name, stores it in a variable, and displays a personalized greeting along with my name.

<h3>Project 3: Snow Cone Stand<h3> 

In this practical application, I create a program to calculate sales tax for a snow cone stand. Using JOptionPane, the program prompts the user to enter the purchase amount and then computes the sales tax, displaying the total sale amount.
