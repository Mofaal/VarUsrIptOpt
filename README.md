<h1>Section 1: Variables & User Input and Output</h1>
Welcome to the showcase of projects from Section 1 of my school learning journey in object-oriented Java programming. This section focuses on the foundational concepts of Variables and User Input and Output. Each project demonstrates my initial exposure to these fundamental concepts and their implementation.

- Section 2: Decision Structures & Control Flows
- Section 3: Methods
- Section 4: Classes & Constructors
- Section 5: Arrays/ArrayList & Array Manipulation

<h2> Overview </h2>
The projects showcased demonstrate a solid foundation in object-oriented programming principles. The programs demonstrate effective code organization, reusability, and modularity through the use of variables, conditional statements, loops, methods, classes, and arrays. In these projects, emphasizing OOP concepts improves code readability, maintainability, and scalability. Proper application of these skills promotes efficient problem-solving and lays the groundwork for future more sophisticated object-oriented Java development.

<h2> Java Skills Demonstrated: </h2>

Throughout the README, the projects demonstrate proficiency in various OOP concepts, empowering the program to be more organized, modular, and efficient. Below is a breakdown of the OOP skills used in each section:

Section 1: Variables & User Input and Output

- Defining and using variables to store and manipulate data such as strings, doubles, and integers.
- Utilizing user input/output mechanisms like Scanner and JOptionPane to interact with users.
- Applying appropriate data types for different variables based on their intended use.

Section 2: Decision Structures & Control Flows

- Implementing conditional statements (if, if-else, switch) to make decisions based on specific conditions.
- Managing control flow to direct the program's execution path, allowing dynamic responses to user input.
- Utilizing loops (while, for, do-while) for iterative processes, enhancing code efficiency.

Section 3: Methods

- Defining and using methods to encapsulate functionality and promote code reusability.
- Breaking down complex tasks into smaller, manageable units using methods.
- Employing method calls to execute specific tasks, improving code organization.

Section 4: Classes & Constructors

- Creating custom classes to represent real-world entities (e.g., Truck class).
- Defining constructors to initialize class objects with specific attributes.
- Encapsulating data fields and methods within classes to achieve data abstraction and information hiding.

Section 5: Arrays/ArrayList & Array Manipulation

- Working with arrays and ArrayLists to store and manipulate collections of data.
- Iterating through arrays and ArrayLists using loops to access and process elements.
- Demonstrating dynamic resizing of ArrayList, adding, and removing items from the list.
